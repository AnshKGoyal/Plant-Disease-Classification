# Plant-Disease-Classification
 The Plant Disease Classification project leverages the NasNetMobile deep learning model to classify plant conditions into five categories: fungus, healthy, virus, pests , and bacteria . Built with a FastAPI backend, SQL Server database, and a Streamlit frontend, the system allows users to upload plant images and receive quick, accurate disease predictions with confidence scores. Key features include user authentication, image upload, community interaction, and activity logging. This open-source project is designed for collaboration, supporting the agricultural community in plant disease diagnosis.
